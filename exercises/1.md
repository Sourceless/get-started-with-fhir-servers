# Exercise 1: Interact with an existing FHIR server
## Useful tools
* https://www.postman.com/
* curl/wget

## Steps
### 1. Take a look at a FHIR server
First off, navigate over to http://hapi.fhir.org/ -- this is a demo fhir server running the HAPI fhir server software. Have a bit of a click around and take a look at what's available.

### 2. List some of the available Patients
Spool up postman or your terminal and then `GET http://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/Patient`. You should be able to see a 'bundle' sent back. This particular one is a listing of patients. Take a look down at the data on offer.

### 3. Drill in to a particular Patient
You can grab a particular ID from one of the patients we just listed, e.g. `636107`. If you then `GET http://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/Patient/636107` you'll see that patient's details only.

### 4. Search patients
Let's try finding an existing patient with the last name `Smith`. To do this, we can use a query parameter called `family` which lets you match against family names.

`GET http://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/Patient?family=Smith`

You should now see a listing with a lot of Smiths on it!

### 5. Look at the other available search parameters
There's a listing of search parameters at https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/patient.html#search -- try some of them out and see what you can find. For more information about how search works, take a look at https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html.

### 6. Create your own Patient
First up, take a look at the available fields at https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/patient.html. Then, put together an example patient.

Here's a minimal one you can use:
```
{
	"resourceType": "Patient",
    "name": {
    	"given": ["Bob"],
    	"family": "Robertson"
    }
}
```

Use this as the body for a `POST http://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/Patient`

### 7. Have a look at the Patient you just created
When you created that Patient, you should have gotten a response that looks something like this:
```
{
  "resourceType": "Patient",
  "id": "636223",
  "meta": {
    "versionId": "1",
    "lastUpdated": "2020-03-04T07:30:23.064+00:00"
  },
  "text": {
    "status": "generated",
    "div": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><table class=\"hapiPropertyTable\"><tbody/></table></div>"
  }
}
```

If you take the `id` field from that response and then GET it, e.g. `GET http://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/Patient/636223` then you should be able to see your newly created patient!

## Extra Tasks
The above cover what you need to move on, but if you want to explore a little more, try the following:
* Create a patient with more fields
* Create a different kind of resource (e.g. an Organization)
* Have a look at the other available resources (https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/resourcelist.html)
* Figure out how to update the Patient you created (clue: https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/http.html)
* Figure out how to delete the Patient you created
