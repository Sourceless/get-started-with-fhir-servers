# Exercise 2: Stand up your own FHIR server

## Steps
### 1: Setup
First, choose one of the methods below to get a simple fhir server running on your system.

Note:
* Vonk is a server written in C# and designed for use with .NET
* HAPI is a server written in Java and designed for use with the JVM

#### Method 1: Docker
If you have docker installed on your system, you can get a fhir server running by using the vonk sqlite image. This is probably the quickest way to get started.

Follow the tutorial here:
http://docs.simplifier.net/vonk/deployment/docker.html

#### Method 2: Vonk setup
Follow the tutorial here:
http://docs.simplifier.net/vonk/getting_started.html

#### Method 3: HAPI Setup
Follow the tutorial here:
https://hapifhir.io/hapi-fhir/docs/server_plain/introduction.html

#### Method 4: Azure FHIR Server
Take a look at what's available here:
https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server

It's worth noting that Microsoft also offer a managed version of this service.

### 2: Interact with your local server
Take a look at some of the interactions you used in [Exercise 1](https://github.com/Sourceless/get-started-with-fhir-servers/blob/master/exercises/1.md) and use them on the server you've just set up.

### 3: Add some data for your use case
Take a look at the list of fhir resources (https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/resourcelist.html) and see if there's anything that would be useful to you. Play around with those resources a little.

## What to do next
You've reached the end of the easy stuff. The next thing to do is to look at the docs for the server you're using and find out how to hook it up to an existing database or system :)
